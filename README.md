# Programmable Packet Scheduling

Prior work has explored programmable packet scheduling on internet routers.
Here we are interested in similar programming on smartNICs.
That is, we want a programmable scheduler to live on the FPGA portion of a smartNIC and decide how packets get scheduled to hosts that can consume those packets.
